# Build-a-band

This project is intended to build a community of musicians who are interested in meeting other local musicians and starting a band or playing at local open mic events. Users are able to specify the instruments that they play and their preferences for other musicians. The app will provide list of nearby artists that match their criteria and location.

For instance:
- I live in San Francisco and I sing and play the piano
- I am looking for a guitarist for an open mic night at a local venue
- I will be connected to guitarists in San Francisco who are seeking vocalists and/or pianists

## Build-a-band v0 - Minimum Viable Product

> The app is built with React Native on the front-end and  Express and PostgreSQL on the backend. The app also uses Google's Geocoding API to pinpoint ZIP locations and prioritize the closest musicians to the user.
